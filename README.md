My first project. Learning coding.  
This site was made based on these lessons https://clck.ru/GqUTo.

I used 
* `NodeJs` as an environment for developing server-side, 
* `MongoDB` as a database,
* `Express` as a framework to help organize web application on the server side,
* `Gulp` as a task runner to automate tasks,
* `JQuery` as an easy way to interact with DOM elements,
* `SCSS` as a CSS preprocessor.
